"""art became sufficiently developed to be embodied
in sonatas. From the beginning of the 17th century until 
late in the 18th, the cantata for one or two solo voices 
with accompaniment of basso continuo (and perhaps a few 
solo instruments) was a principal form of Italian vocal 
chamber music.A cantata consisted first of a declamatory 
narrative or scene in recitative, held together by a 
primitive aria repeated at intervals. Fine examples may 
be found in the church music of Giacomo Carissimi; and 
the English vocal solos of Henry Purcell (such as Mad 
Tom and Mad Bess) show the utmost that can be made of 
this archaic form. With the rise of the da capo aria, 
the cantata became a group of two or three arias joined
by recitative. George Frideric Handel's numerous Italian' \
'duets and trios are examples on a rather large' \
scale. His Latin motet Silete Venti, for soprano solo, shows the use of this form in church music"""
